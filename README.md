# AddProduct Component

## Description
The `AddProduct.jsx` component is a React-based form used for adding new products to an e-commerce platform. It allows users to input product details such as name, category, new price, old price, and upload an image. The form data is sent to a backend server for processing.

## Features
- **State Management**: The component uses React's `useState` hook to manage form inputs and image data.
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload a product image, which is sent to the server along with other product details.
- **Form Handling**: Product details including name, category, new price, and old price are handled through form inputs.
- **API Interaction**: The component sends a `POST` request to a specified API endpoint to upload the product data.

## How to Use
1. Place the `AddProduct.jsx` component in your desired directory.
2. Import the necessary CSS and assets as per the component dependencies.
3. The component contains the following product fields:
   - **name**: The name of the product.

   - **image**: A product image file upload field.

4. On form submission, the product data and the uploaded image are sent to the server using the `fetch` API.

## Example Code
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import './Addproduct.css';
import upload_area from '../../assets/upload_area.svg';

const Addproduct = () => {
    const [image, setImage] = useState(false);
    const [productDetails, setProductDetails] = useState({
        name: "",
        image: "",
        category: "women",
        new_price: "",
        old_price: ""
    });

    const imageHandler = (e) => {
        setImage(e.target.files[0]);
    };

    const changeHandler = (e) => {
        setProductDetails({ ...productDetails, [e.target.name]: e.target.value });
    };

    const Add_Product = async () => {
        let formData = new FormData();
        formData.append('product', image);

        await fetch('https://smart-shopper-e79a.onrender.com/upload', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                Accept: 'application/json',
            },
            body: formData
        });
    };

    return (

# React Application Entry Point

This is the entry point for your React application, typically where the root component is rendered into the DOM. It also integrates with libraries like React Router for routing and Redux for state management if applicable.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)
- **npm** or **yarn**

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

The app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Overview of `main.jsx`

The `main.jsx` file is typically responsible for rendering the root component (often `App.jsx`) into the DOM. Hereâ€™s a basic structure of what `main.jsx` might look like:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';  // Assuming App.jsx is your main component
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';  // Optional if using React Router

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));

root.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```

### Key Components

- **ReactDOM.createRoot**: This is used to initialize the React application and render it into the DOM.
- **App Component**: The main component where all the application logic and routing takes place.
- **BrowserRouter**: This is included if React Router is being used for client-side routing.

## Additional Libraries

Depending on the application, you might be using additional libraries. Common ones include:

- **React Router**: For handling routing in the application.
- **Redux**: For managing global state.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to your backend API.

## File Structure

Here's an example of the file structure relevant to `main.jsx`:

```
/src
  â”œâ”€â”€ /components  # Reusable components
  â”œâ”€â”€ /pages       # Application pages
  â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx      # Main component
  â”œâ”€â”€ main.jsx     # Entry point file
  â””â”€â”€ index.html   # HTML file where the React app is mounted
```

## Building for Production

To create a production build, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build/` folder with all the optimized production files, ready for deployment.

# CartItems Component

## Overview
The `CartItems` component is part of a React shopping cart application. It displays the items that the user has added to their shopping cart, along with their details such as product title, price, quantity, and total cost per item. Users can also remove items from the cart using this component.

## Key Features
- Displays product details (title, price, quantity, total, and a remove button).
- Integrates with the global `ShopContext` for state management.
- Allows users to remove items from their cart.

## File Structure
- **CartItems.jsx**: The main component file.
- **CartItems.css**: The stylesheet that handles the component's styling.
- **cart_cross_icon.png**: An icon for removing items from the cart.

## Dependencies
- **React**: Core library for building the user interface.
- **ShopContext**: Context API used for managing the state of the cart and its items.

## Usage

### Importing the Component
To use the `CartItems` component in your application:
```js
import { CartItems } from './path/to/CartItems';
```

### Required Context
The component uses the following values from the `ShopContext`:
- **getTotalCartAmount**: Function to get the total cart amount.
- **all_product**: Array containing all available products.
- **cartItems**: Object holding the quantity of each item in the cart.
- **removeFromCart**: Function to remove an item from the cart.

### Example
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { CartItems } from './components/CartItems';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <CartItems />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Component Logic

1. **Rendering Cart Items**: 
   The component maps through the `all_product` array and checks whether an item is present in the `cartItems` object. If the item has a quantity greater than zero, it displays the item in the cart.

2. **Removing Items**: 
   Each item has a remove button (rendered as an image) that, when clicked, triggers the `removeFromCart` function to remove the item from the cart.

## Styling
The component's layout is controlled through `CartItems.css`, which ensures proper formatting of the product grid.

- **Navbar.css**: The stylesheet for handling the layout and design of the navigation bar.
  
## Dependencies
- **React**: The core library for building the user interface.
- **React Router (optional)**: If the navigation is dependent on routing between different pages.
- **Context (optional)**: If integrated with a context API to manage cart states or user data.

## Usage

### Importing the Component
To use the `Navbar` component, import it into your app:
```js
import { Navbar } from './path/to/Navbar';
```

### Example Usage
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Navbar } from './components/Navbar';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Navbar />
      {/* Other components like homepage, shop, etc. */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Component Logic

1. **Navigation Links**: 
   The component typically renders a set of links or buttons that allow the user to navigate to different sections of the app.

2. **Cart Icon**: 
   If integrated with a shopping cart system, the `Navbar` might display a cart icon with the current number of items in the cart, using state from a context like `ShopContext` to track this data.

3. **Responsive Design**: 
   The `Navbar` is often designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

## Styling
The `Navbar.css` file is used to control the layout, ensuring that elements are properly aligned and styled. Custom styles may include background colors, font styles, spacing, and hover effects for links.

## Customization
You can customize the `Navbar` component by adding:
- Additional navigation links.
- A logo or brand name in the header.
