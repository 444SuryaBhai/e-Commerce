# AddProduct Component

## Description
The `AddProduct.jsx` component is a React-based form used for adding new products to an e-commerce platform. It allows users to input product details such as name, category, new price, old price, and upload an image. The form data is sent to a backend server for processing.

## Features
- **State Management**: The component uses React's `useState` hook to manage form inputs and image data.
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload a product image, which is sent to the server along with other product details.
- **Form Handling**: Product details including name, category, new price, and old price are handled through form inputs.
- **API Interaction**: The component sends a `POST` request to a specified API endpoint to upload the product data.

## How to Use
1. Place the `AddProduct.jsx` component in your desired directory.
2. Import the necessary CSS and assets as per the component dependencies.
3. The component contains the following product fields:
   - **name**: The name of the product.
   - **category**: Default set to "women", can be modified to other categories.
   - **new_price**: The new price of the product.
   - **old_price**: The original price before discount.
   - **image**: A product image file upload field.

4. On form submission, the product data and the uploaded image are sent to the server using the `fetch` API.

## Example Code
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import './Addproduct.css';
import upload_area from '../../assets/upload_area.svg';

const Addproduct = () => {
    const [image, setImage] = useState(false);
    const [productDetails, setProductDetails] = useState({
        name: "",
        image: "",
        category: "women",
        new_price: "",
        old_price: ""
    });

    const imageHandler = (e) => {
        setImage(e.target.files[0]);
    };

    const changeHandler = (e) => {
        setProductDetails({ ...productDetails, [e.target.name]: e.target.value });
    };

    const Add_Product = async () => {
        let formData = new FormData();
        formData.append('product', image);

        await fetch('https://smart-shopper-e79a.onrender.com/upload', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                Accept: 'application/json',
            },
            body: formData
        });
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <!-- Your JSX and form elements go here -->
        </div>
    );
};

export default Addproduct;



# Creating the content for README.md based on the Listproduct component functionality

# ListProduct Component

## Description
The `ListProduct.jsx` component is a React-based product listing feature that fetches a list of products from a backend API and displays them in a structured format. Additionally, it allows users to remove products from the list.

## Features
- **Product Fetching**: The component fetches all available products from the API and stores them in the component's state.
- **Display Product List**: Displays the fetched products in a visually structured layout.
- **Remove Product**: Sends a `POST` request to remove a product based on its ID.
- **State Management**: Uses React's `useState` and `useEffect` to handle product data and API interactions.

## How to Use
1. **Fetch Products**: When the component mounts, it automatically calls the `fetchInfo` function to retrieve all products from the API.
   - API Endpoint: `https://smart-shopper-e79a.onrender.com/allproducts` (GET)

2. **Remove a Product**: The component includes a remove button, which sends a request to remove a product by its `id`.
   - API Endpoint: `https://smart-shopper-e79a.onrender.com/removeproduct` (POST)
   - The ID of the product is sent as the payload in the request body.

## Example Code
```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import './Listproduct.css';
import cross_icon from '../../assets/cross_icon.png';

const Listproduct = () => {
    const [allproducts, setAllProducts] = useState([]);

    const fetchInfo = async () => {
        await fetch('https://smart-shopper-e79a.onrender.com/allproducts')
            .then((res) => res.json())
            .then((data) => { setAllProducts(data); });
    }

    useEffect(() => {
        fetchInfo();
    }, []);

    const remove_product = async (id) => {
        await fetch('https://smart-shopper-e79a.onrender.com/removeproduct', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                Accept: 'application/json',
                'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({ id: id }),
        });
        await fetchInfo();
    }

    return (
        <div className='list-product'>
            <h1>All Products List</h1>
            <div className="listproduct-format-main">
                {allproducts.map((product) => (
                    <div key={product._id} className="product-item">
                        <img src={product.image} alt={product.name} />
                        <h2>{product.name}</h2>
                        <button onClick={() => remove_product(product._id)}>
                            Remove <img src={cross_icon} alt="Remove" />
                        </button>
                    </div>
                ))}
            </div>
        </div>
    );

# App Component

## Overview
The `App.jsx` file is the main entry point of your React application. It is responsible for rendering the core structure of your app, integrating components like the `Navbar`, `Admin`, and any other UI elements.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for dependency management
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for rendering components

## Installation

1. Clone or copy the `App.jsx` file into your React project.

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>


Install project dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install


Ensure the App.jsx file is correctly imported and integrated into the index.js (or similar entry point):

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));



Usage
The App.jsx component typically integrates various other components, such as:

import React from 'react';
import Navbar from './Navbar'; // A navigation bar component
import Admin from './Admin'; // An admin dashboard component

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar />
      <Admin />
      {/* Other components can be added here */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

You can customize the component by:

Adding new routes for navigation.
Managing the state for global application features.
Including additional components.


Running the App
To start the development server:

npm start
# or
yarn start


This will run the app at http://localhost:3000.

Customization
The App.jsx component can be customized to fit your applicationâ€™s structure:

Add routes: Implement routing for different sections of the app using libraries like react-router.
State management: Use useState or useContext for managing the global state.
Styling: Apply styles or themes globally through the App.jsx component.


Contributing
To contribute to this component:

Fork the repository.
Create a new branch for your feature (git checkout -b feature-branch).
Commit your changes (git commit -m 'Add new feature').
Push to the branch (git push origin feature-branch).
Submit a pull request.

# Environment Variables

This project requires environment variables to connect to external services. The `.env` file is used to store these variables securely.

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Add the following environment variable to the file:

   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.x0j21.mongodb.net/<database>"
   ```

   - Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your MongoDB credentials.
   - Replace `<database>` with the name of the MongoDB database you are using.

## Important

- **Do not share** your `.env` file publicly or commit it to version control, as it contains sensitive information.
- Ensure that the `.env` file is included in your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental exposure of your credentials.
